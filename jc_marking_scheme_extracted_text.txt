Note to teachers and students on the use of published marking schemes 
 
Marking schemes published by the State Examinations Commission are not intended to be 
standalone documents.  They are an essential resource for examiners who receive training 
in the correct interpretation and application of the scheme.  This training involves, among 
other things, marking samples of student work and discussing the marks awarded, so as to 
clarify the correct application of the scheme.  The work of examiners is subsequently 
monitored by Advising Examiners to ensure consistent and accurate application of the 
marking scheme.  This process is overseen by the Chief Examiner, usually assisted by a Chief 
Advising Examiner.  The Chief Examiner is the final authority regarding whether or not the 
marking scheme has been correctly applied to any piece of candidate work. 
Marking schemes are working documents.  While a draft marking scheme is prepared in 
advance of the examination, the scheme is not finalised until examiners have applied it to 
candidates’ work and the feedback from all examiners has been collated and considered in 
light of the full range of responses of candidates, the overall level of difficulty of the 
examination and the need to maintain consistency in standards from year to year.  This 
published document contains the finalised scheme, as it was applied to all candidates’ work. 
In the case of marking schemes that include model solutions or answers, it should be noted 
that these are not intended to be exhaustive.  Variations and alternatives may also be 
acceptable.  Examiners must consider all answers on their merits, and will have consulted 
with their Advising Examiners when in doubt. 
Future Marking Schemes 
Assumptions about future marking schemes on the basis of past schemes should be 
avoided.  While the underlying assessment principles remain the same, the details of the 
marking of a particular type of question may change in the context of the contribution of 
that question to the overall examination in a given year.  The Chief Examiner in any given 
year has the responsibility to determine how best to ensure the fair and accurate 
assessment of candidates’ work and to ensure consistency in the standard of the 
assessment from year to year.  Accordingly, aspects of the structure, detail and application 
of the marking scheme for a particular examination are subject to change from one year to 
the next without notice.

General Indicators of Quality. 
 
Material presented should be considered under the following 
 
 
criteria: 
 
• Focus – To what extent has a candidate answered the question asked? 
• Ideas – To what extent is higher-order thinking shown, complexity of ideas, 
originality of thought? 
• Development – to what extent has a candidate explored ideas in depth including 
the use of supporting material? 
• Coherence – to what extent has a candidate stayed on task and organised a 
response into a well-structured piece of writing, including the use of paragraphing, 
in a meaningful 
 
 
 
way? 
• Expression – how clear and fluent is the candidate’s language?  Is sentencing 
clear 
and coherent - are there grammatical errors? 
• Register – to what extent is the candidate’s register / tone / level of formal – 
informal language used, appropriate to the task? 
• Creativity – where appropriate to the task, to what extent has the candidate 
demonstrated an ability to think and write creatively? 
• Spelling and written punctuation - How accurate is a candidate’s spelling and use 
of written punctuation? 
 
Errors of spelling and written punctuation should not be penalised in excess of ten 
percent of the marks assigned to any question awarded 10 marks or more. It may be 
possible for a candidate to make a small number of spelling or punctuation errors and 
have no penalty imposed. Examiners should consider the standard of vocabulary used by 
a candidate. Assessment of spelling and written punctuation does not apply in the case of 
multiple-choice questions or in the case 
of candidates granted the spelling and written 
punctuation waiver.  Use the following table to guide your judgement.

Appendix 1 
Reasonable Accommodation - Modified Scheme 
A modified marking scheme is applied to the work submitted by candidates who have been 
granted one or a combination of the following reasonable accommodations: 
• The use of a tape recorder 
• The use of a scribe 
• The use of a laptop or PC with the spell-check facility enabled 
• A waiver for spelling and written punctuation. 
For Junior Cycle English this means that errors in spelling and written punctuation are not 
penalised. 
You should not consider spelling and written punctuation when forming your impression of 
this work. You should not underline spelling and written punctuation errors. 
For example, there should be no penalty for spelling errors in the following cases: 
(a) The bus was purpel. 
(b) I was so exited to be visiting New York. 
(c) I walked proudly up to the podium to recieve my prize 
Or in the case of misused homophones: 
(d) The whether forecast is bad for tomorrow. 
Or written punctuation errors in cases like the 
following: 
(e) When is the bus coming. 
(f) Isnt it cold today. 
(g) Seáns new car is fantastic.

Appendix 2 Note in relation to prescription 2023 
 
The prescribed texts for 2023 are outlined in DES Circular 0037/2018. Any concerns you have in 
relation to the validity of texts used by a candidate should be referred to your advising examiner.   
 
When answering a question on studied texts, if the candidate uses a text that is not in line with the 
texts prescribed for study in 2023, the candidate’s response should be marked out of the marks 
allocated for that question and the result divided by two and rounded down. 
 
Please do the calculation on paper and enter the correct/adjusted mark on RM Assessor.   
 
For question 5, if the candidate uses the poem on the paper, mark each answer on its merits and 
award half the marks in each case.
